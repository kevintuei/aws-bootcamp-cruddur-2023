# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

During Week 0 I managed to achieve the following:

By watching through the Bootcamp Playlist I managed to install and configure the Pre-requisites, for some like an AWS Account I already had one and only needed to ensure that I set budget and connect other accounts with the Github account that has the respository. 

It was also fascinating to understand that there are several new tolls I never knew about that we are going to use throughout the duration of the bootcamp.

After creating an account on LucidCharts and setting up the AWS Architecture Icons after following the playlist video, I tested it out by creating a typical three-tier web application to be deployed on AWS.

I will continue doing more on billing and arcitecture even as I replicate the Cruddur Architecture on LucidCharts.
